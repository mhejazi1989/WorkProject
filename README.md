# Python & Data Handling Mastery â€“ 1 Month Challenge

## Overview
This repository documents my 1-month journey to strengthen Python fundamentals, build data handling skills using `pandas` and `NumPy`, and prepare for live coding interviews.  
The goal is to develop a solid base for technical interviews and data-centric projects.

---

## Goals
- Build strong Python programming fluency.
- Master essential libraries: `pandas` & `NumPy`.
- Solve coding challenges to improve problem-solving skills.
- Complete small projects to apply learned concepts.

---

## Weekly Breakdown
### **Week 1: Python + Data Handling + Interview Coding**
- **Focus**: Python core syntax, control flow, functions, and data structures.
- **Practice**: HackerRank/LeetCode Python warmup problems.
- **Goal**: Comfort with coding syntax & simple problem-solving.

### **Week 2: NumPy & Pandas Foundations**
- Array operations, indexing, slicing, reshaping.
- DataFrame manipulation: filtering, grouping, merging.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) mini-project.

### **Week 3: Intermediate Projects & Interview Practice**
- Apply skills in small projects (e.g., data cleaning pipeline, CSV analysis).
- Practice algorithm problems (sorting, searching, recursion).

### **Week 4: Capstone & Review**
- Build a final mini-project integrating Python + pandas/NumPy.
- Review key concepts for interviews.

---

## Deliverables
- Daily practice scripts & notebooks.
- Weekly mini-projects.
- Final capstone project demonstrating complete workflow.
