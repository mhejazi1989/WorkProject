 Music Genre Prediction with Decision Trees

This is a small machine learning project where I practiced using a Decision Tree Classifier to predict a person’s favorite music genre based on their age and gender.

What I Did

Loaded and prepared the dataset (music.csv)

Trained a Decision Tree model

Tested the accuracy of the model

Saved the model so it can be reused later

Visualized the tree to see how the model makes decisions

Setup

To run this project, install the dependencies first:

pip install -r requirements.txt

requirements.txt
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
joblib

How to Run

Make sure music.csv is in the same folder as the notebook.

Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook DecisionTree_Project_Updated.ipynb


Run the cells in order to see the results.

 Results

The Decision Tree model trained successfully

It reached good accuracy on the test split

I saved the model using joblib

The visualization shows the rules the model uses for predictions
